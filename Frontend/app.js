Im gonna need 
1. Logic for selecting the buttons
    As in: a button either tim, demetri, or griffin is selected
    Put an event handler in there to listen to which button is selected
    When you select a button, all data needs to go to that unique person
    When you enter times into text fields that data needs to get pushed to that unique person
    All that data needs to get stored to an array somewhere in the backend
